Here's a breakdown based on the information provided:\\n\\n**Eligibility:**\\n\\n* **CG Cutoff:**  The minimum CGPA requirement is 7+ for software engineering internships. For hardware-related roles, the cutoff is 8+.\\n* **Branch:** Open to students from A7, A3, A8, and AA branches (single and dual degree).\\n\\n**Recruitment Process:**\\n\\n**Round 1: Online Assessment (Software Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Duration:** 1.5 hours.\\n* **Content:** Two questions based on basic concepts covered in CS F211 - Data Structures and Algorithms. The difficulty level is rated as easy to medium.\\n* **Key:**  Time management is crucial. Aim to finish as quickly as possible while ensuring accuracy.\\n\\n**Round 2: Technical Interview 1 (Software Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Duration:** Approximately one hour.\\n* **Content:**\\n    * **Introduction:**  Begins with an introduction and discussion about your projects and internship experiences.\\n    * **Technical Depth:**  In-depth questions about the tech stack and concepts used in your projects.\\n    * **Design Patterns:** Basic to moderate questions on design patterns covered in CS F213 - Object-Oriented Programming.\\n    * **Coding:**  A coding question related to concepts covered in CS F211 - Data Structures and Algorithms. You need to pass specific test cases.\\n\\n**Round 3: DSA Interview (Software Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Content:**\\n    * **Project Discussion:**  The interviewer will delve into your resume projects.\\n    * **DSA Segment:**  In-depth discussion on sorting algorithms, likely covering your approach to preparing for DSA interviews using LeetCode and the CS F211 course content.  Expect detailed discussions on quick sort and merge sort.\\n\\n**Round 4: CS Fundamentals Interview (Software Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Content:**  This round focuses on your understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.\\n\\n**Round 1: Online Assessment (Hardware Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Duration:**  Not specified.\\n* **Content:**  Three challenging coding questions. Examples include:\\n    * Implementing a spiral output given a starting corner.\\n    * A question based on graphs, described as particularly tricky.\\n    * A problem involving dynamic programming, binary search, and bitmasking.\\n\\n**Round 2: Online Assessment 2 (Hardware Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Content:**  Shortlisting round, likely based on the previous round and your resume.  The questions are relatively easy and short in duration.  They focus on implementation-based problems, comparable to medium-level LeetCode questions.  The questions are more design-based than purely algorithmic.\\n\\n**Round 2: Technical Interview (Hardware Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Content:**  The round mainly covers questions based on ECE/EEE/INSTR F215 - Digital Design. It also includes basic questions related to the third-year course CDC - EEE/INSTR F313 - Analog Digital VLSI Design.  While not a specific course requirement, it's helpful to understand basic concepts like Static Time Analysis.  The interview will focus on topics covered in the courses.\\n\\n**Round 3: Personal Interview (Hardware Engineering)**\\n\\n* **Duration:**  Approximately 40 minutes.\\n* **Content:**  This round is like a personality test.  You'll be presented with situations and asked questions to gauge your professional ethics and how you would respond to different situations.
